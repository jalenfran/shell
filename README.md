# jshell

A UNIX shell implemented in C with features including history navigation, file and history completion and basic command execution.

## Features

- **Command Execution:**
    Executes external commands using 'execvp' with support for built-in comands

- **History Navigation:**
    Use the Up/Down arrow keys to navigate through your command history.

- **Completion:**
    - **History Completion (Whole line):** Pressing tab completes the input using the history list.
    - **File Completion (last word):** If no history match is found, tab attempts to finds files and directories in the current directory

## Project Structure

```
shell/
|-- bin/            # Executable output directory (generated by Makefile)
|-- obj/            # Object files directory (generated by Makefile)
|-- src/            # Source code for the shell
|   |-- main.c      # Main file containing the shell loop and command exeecution logic
|   |-- input.c     # Handles input, history, and completion
|   |-- parser.c    # Parses input into tokens
|   |-- executor.c  # handles command execution
|-- Makefile        # Makefile to build the project
|-- README.md       # this file

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/jalenfran/shell.git
    cd shell
    ```

2. **Build the Project:**
    ```shell
    make
    ```

3. **Run the Shell:**
    ```shell
    ./bin/shell
    ```

## Usage

- **Built-in Commands:**
    - `cd <directory>`: Changes the current directory.
    - `exit`: Exit the shell.

- **History Navigation:**
    Use the Up and Down arrow keys to scroll through your command history

- **Command Completion:**
    Press tab to complete commands. The shell first attempts to complete the line based on your history. If there is no history match, then it looks to match the last word with file and directory names

## Cleaning Up

``shell
make clean
```
